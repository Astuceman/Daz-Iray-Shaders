Every shaders are stored in the dedicated folders

You can see the renders in Shader-ball-scene and Shader-simulation-exercise folder
Shader-stress-test are usefull if you want to test in some different and heavy light situation. Download Duf files and go testing !

If you don't know how github work look at this beginning article https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ or ask me for help

Rules :
- Don't post what is not yours (duh) but you can post shaders or renders if you have the direct autorisation of the creator and explain what we do here with the direct link to the project (https://github.com/Astuceman/hello-world)
- You can't post shaders with texture (planed in the future)
- You can't post material preset (planed in the future)
- English is the default language (duh)
