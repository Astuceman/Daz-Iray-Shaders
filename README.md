# How that work ?
Every shaders are stored in the dedicated folders

- `Shaders`               Shaders .dsa files + icon
- `Ball-scene-renders`    Render of ball scene to see how the shader look
- `Example-renders`       Example render of one shader in many situation (no rules)
- `Stress-test`           Test scene to figure out if your shader work in every situations

There is three branch for now :

1. **Master** : every one will see it at first and it need to be test and bug free. This is the stable branch
2. **New Shaders** : When you have created something completly new and want simply to add it after some feedbacks if you ask it
3. **Update shaders** : Basicaly when you want to polish or update any file. Add modification to something that exist allready


If you don't know how github work look at this beginning article https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ or `ask me` for help

**Have fun**  :smiley:

Rules :
- Don't post what's not yours (duh) but you can post shaders or renders if you have the direct autorisation of the creator and explain what we do here with the direct link to the project (https://github.com/Astuceman/Daz-Iray-Shaders)
- English is the default language (duh)
- Shader format is <a href="https://youtu.be/wvOotDR_cuI" target="_blank">.DSA</a> and not .DUF (.DUF cannot be read by an text editor)

Planed in the future :
- shaders with texture
- material preset
